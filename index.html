<h1>Marvel around the WORLD for updates with us in technological and environmental awareness </h1>
<p>Welcome !!! Tendo humbly welcomes you to the centre of knowledge where you are to get enlightenment on a number of various eye opening content running around the world exclusively.... continue browsing through because it's about technology and global conservation
Our planet, a vibrant tapestry of ecosystems, is facing an unprecedented challenge. Human activity has pushed the environment to a tipping point, threatening the delicate balance that sustains all life. Environmental conservation, therefore, emerges not as a luxury, but as an absolute necessity.
For millennia, humanity has thrived on the bounty of the Earth. Forests provided clean air and fertile soil, oceans teemed with life, and diverse ecosystems maintained a natural order. However, our insatiable consumption and disregard for sustainable practices have led to deforestation, pollution, and climate change. These issues are interconnected, creating a domino effect that disrupts natural habitats, drives species extinction, and threatens the very foundation of our existence.
The consequences of environmental degradation are far-reaching. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, extreme weather events displace populations, and air pollution jeopardizes human health. The delicate balance within ecosystems, where each species plays a vital role, is disrupted, leading to cascading effects that weaken the entire web of life.
Despite the bleak outlook, there is hope. Environmental conservation offers a path forward. It encompasses a range of actions aimed at protecting our natural resources and mitigating the damage we have caused. Sustainable practices like renewable energy use, responsible resource management, and habitat restoration play a crucial role. Additionally, fostering a deep appreciation for the environment through education and outreach campaigns is vital in creating a generation of responsible stewards.
Conservation efforts are not just about preserving landscapes; they are about safeguarding our own future. A healthy environment provides clean air and water, regulates the climate, and offers a vast array of resources that are essential for human well-being and economic prosperity. By investing in conservation, we invest in our own security and ensure a livable planet for generations to come.
The path to environmental conservation requires a collective effort. Individuals can make a difference by adopting sustainable practices in their daily lives. Governments can implement policies that incentivize environmental responsibility and discourage harmful activities. Businesses can integrate sustainability into their operations and invest in green technologies. By working together, we can create a future where human progress and environmental protection go hand-in-hand.
In conclusion, environmental conservation is not a choice but a necessity. It is the responsibility of every individual and organization to take action. By acknowledging the urgency of the crisis and taking concrete steps towards a sustainable future, we can ensure a healthy planet for ourselves and all living things.</p>

	<p style="font-size: 30px; color: green"> Water pollution </p>
	<p>A massive number of water bodies are being put under degradation in a variety of stances in a way that makes the reaction irreversible. Mainly the use of polyethene has gone viral and later on disposal runs it into water bodies. This is done when:
Firstly, direct disposal into water bodies on individual basis. This is quite common with people setting at the shores and by navigators by way of water (some in the name of fun) which is quite over degradational. 
According to science and future forecast, if this is not put to an end, the era of fresh water bodies would be put to an end. This brings an end to a number of aquatic life taking some species to extinction (endangered) within a time frame of not more than 10 years. Resolutions of water body fencing have been put up but according to statistics, it starts at individual basis.
Environmentalists around the globe ðŸŒŽ claim that according to physics, all plastics and foreign water bodies are sailed down to the coast even at any length of a water body, they are eventually drained out by waves.... But this is of no importance if people are not self driven towards pulling out the waste and proper disposition put into place.
