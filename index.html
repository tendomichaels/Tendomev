<h1>Marvel around the WORLD for updates with us in technological and environmental awareness </h1>
<p>Welcome !!! Tendo humbly welcomes you to the centre of knowledge where you are to get enlightenment on a number of various eye opening content running around the world exclusively.... continue browsing through because it's about technology and global conservation</p>
	<p style="font-size: 30px; color: green> Water pollution </p>
	<p>A massive number of water bodies are being put under degradation in a variety of stances in a way that makes the reaction irreversible. Mainly the use of polyethene has gone viral and later on disposal runs it into water bodies. This is done when:
Firstly, direct disposal into water bodies on individual basis. This is quite common with people setting at the shores and by navigators by way of water (some in the name of fun) which is quite over degradational. 
According to science and future forecast, if this is not put to an end, the era of fresh water bodies would be put to an end. This brings an end to a number of aquatic life taking some species to extinction (endangered) within a time frame of not more than 10 years. Resolutions of water body fencing have been put up but according to statistics, it starts at individual basis.
Environmentalists around the globe ðŸŒŽ claim that according to physics, all plastics and foreign water bodies are sailed down to the coast even at any length of a water body, they are eventually drained out by waves.... But this is of no importance if people are not self driven towards pulling out the waste and proper disposition put into place.
